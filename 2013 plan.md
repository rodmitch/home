3-5 measurable goals for each. Plus: “Actions Required for Each Goal.” In other words, what do I need to do (next) to achieve each goal?

Attention: This is very important! Without completing this section, you’ll have a vision without a plan. You need to have both.

Objective: I want to be fit, healthy, and strong. Physically and spiritually. 
 
*Personal Development
-exercise routine 4 days/week (3 swim/2 bodyweight)
-establish new average weight of 185 (be good about No S)
-reduce buckets and purge some crap from clothes and garage (focus on this; room by room)
-OLJ (OhLife and iDoneThis)
Weekly memory verse (maybe?)
Weekly virtue (see note)
Monthly book (Already a month behind. Feb: Give them grace, Mar: Shepherding)

*Spouse
-plan weekly date nights
-plan weekly prayer nights (do better at this; plan 2 nights/week, maybe Mon and Wed)
-plan 1 weekend away this year (figure out the best time to do this between WA in March and MN in September)
-love Stacy better (think of something special every 2 weeks)

*Children
-plan devotions/Family worship weekly (need diversity and consistency)
-plan for NRM's preschool (help Stacy with resources)
-monthly date night with NRM and ENM, each

*Family
-call family on Birthdays and Holidays
-call M&D weekly
-talk to Dena more
-Get them to set up Skype/gChat

*Friends
-KIT with 1 friend every 10 days/month (lunch or call)(why? who?)
-Occasional man nights

*Spiritual Development
-pray daily (restart prayer list)
-read daily (book/month)
-memorize verse/week (Twitter list)

*Career Development
-dedicated, diligent, glorify God, example, set standard, priority
-24hr turn-around on email and phone calls
-5 min early to meetings
-track project roles weekly
-WeekPlan.net or TeuxDeux.com
-Triple Task
-figure out how to reduce hours and increase pay

*Financial Development
-budget organization (get more control over budget, restrict spending--stick to the budget, track spending)
--stick to budget, anything additional goes to the following plan:
--$150/mo (plus additional amount from W4 adjustment) to savings to build:
---emergency fund up to $1200
---rental maintenance yp to $1400
--then divert that amount (plus tax return) to pay off debt in this order:
---prosper1 (should be paid off completely with tax refund)
---BofA (cancel before May to avoid annual fee, this will be difficult to do and the $75 fee is probably less than a loan transfer fee plus interest between May and Sept)
---prosper2
--this can be done by by the end of 2012 by selling the Kia (~$12K), paying off the loan (~$7K), buying a van with the difference (~5K), and that frees up $381/month to do the above faster.
-savings
--build up funds (gifts,clothes,house,car repair) then divert that money to pay off debt
--save car repair fund 20% pymt to 10% value ($80/1400)
--save home repair fund 20% pymt to 10% value($240/20000))
--savings accounts
---$1200 emergency fund (1 month rent)
---$1400 rental maintenance fund (1 mortgage pymnt)
---gifts $65/mo
---travel (save for ?)
---$1400 gas/car maintenance fund (postpone until out of debt or we do Kia deal)
-double income in 5 years
-Get out of debt by end of 2011, that's 24 months (excl. mortgage, --car--)(including car!)
-plan to buy house or invest

*Sound Ministry Development
-new sound guys: [no]
-improvements? [no]

*[food]
-Weber gas grill
-Iron Chef-like event [no]

*[tech]
-learn programing language

*[travel]
